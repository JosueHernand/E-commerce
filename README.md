# Retail Data Integration

## Description

As a manager at an internet retail company, I have developed a resilient back end for our e-commerce website utilizing the latest technologies. The primary motivation behind this project was to ensure that our company remains competitive in the fiercely competitive e-commerce industry. This project will help us by staying competitive in the fast paced e-commerce industry. By adopting the latest technologies, our website becomes more appealing to customers. While working on this project I learned how to use the ORM system.
